ðŸ“ƒ ADT SortedList â€” Doubly Linked List with Integer Indexing

This project implements a **SortedList Abstract Data Type (ADT)** using a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)**.  
Elements are always kept in order based on a given **binary relation** (e.g., ascending or descending), and can be accessed via **integer-based positions** (`TPozition = int`).
