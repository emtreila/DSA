# 🗂️ MultiMap ADT — DLLA-Based Implementation

This project implements a **MultiMap Abstract Data Type** using a **doubly linked list array (DLLA)**. Each key in the map can be associated with **multiple values**, and all key-value pairs are stored in a **custom dynamic list structure** that supports efficient add, remove, and search operations.
